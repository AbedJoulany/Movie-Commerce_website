# Initializing the template

In order to initialize the project make sure to:

1. When you open the project, if intelliJ propose to "Load Maven Project" do it. You can later reload maven with the "M" icon on the right of the screen, or by right clicking on the pom.xml file and selecting "Maven -> Reload project".
2. You see red lines in the code? Go to File -> Project Structure -> Project Settings -> Project -> SDK -> and choose your Java SDK
3. Still see red stuff? Open the same dialog and click on "Fix" if you see some
4. Edit your configuration. Make sure the "Main class" is set to "hac.DemoApplication" and that Java is set

Everything ok?
1. The DB credentials are stored in the application.properties file. You may change them if you want.
2. Run the project, you should not see any errors in IntelliJ console

So far the only route you can check is http://localhost:8080/debug/purchases
that returns a list of all purchases in the DB (empty for now).

## Initializing the React client (movie-app)

Open a terminal in *movie-app* and run `npm install` and then `npm start`. You should see the client running on http://localhost:3000.
You can also open another instance of IntelliJ and open the *movie-app* folder as a project. You can then run the client from there.

- you may need to run `npm i mdb-ui-kit` if error happens with the frontend design

## Using the provided code to store purchases in the DB

We provide you with ready-to-use code to store purchases in the DB, in order to give you a taste of what Spring can do for you.
Look at the DebugController class. It has a method called "addPurchase" that receives a Purchase object and stores it in the DB.
When you develop your own controller, you must declare the repository member exactly as it is declared in the DebugController class.
Then you can use it to store purchases in the DB (repository.save(purchase)).
